Trends in Data Science
Data science is broad and in demand field, and according to the U.S. Bureau of labor Statistics, is predicted to grow by 35% between 2022 and 2032. As emerging Data Scientists, we set out to analyze current trends in salary for Data Science roles and find out what criteria lead to the highest paying careers.

The dataset is based on survey submissions and jobs with open salaries (https://ai-jobs.net/salaries/2024/).

The dataset we analysed contains 14,000+ rows of data covering the following:
Timeframe: 2020 -2024

Experience level: Entry, Mid, Senior, Executive
Job Titles: 149
Work Setting: In-person, Remote, Hybrid


What jobs show the most growth?
    We will look at the most popular jobs and how they have changed over the years 2020-2024
We will take a specific look at the percentage of data science jobs based on popularity through the those years
We will determine which four data science jobs are the most popular throughout the years














What Countries pay the best salaries?
We will look at the different types of work settings available
We will look at which countries currently have the most jobs
We will look at the average salaries broken down by their country














How does experience influence salary?
We will look at the average salaries separated by the level of experience an employee has
We will look at the ranges of the maximum and minimum salaries determined by experience
We will looks at the average salaries of the top jobs we have previously found and break them down by experience level











-What data science jobs show the most growth?
Conclusion:
Based on our review the highest paying job in the US for an entry-level position in 2024 would be Machine Learning Engineer
The average salary of with these specific criteria is $126,118.85
For remote work, the highest paying job is Data Scientist with an average salary of $105,000
The most popular in 2024 job was Data Scientist despite it not having the highest average salary overall





Questions Requiring Further Analysis:
A further explanation for why there are less of the highest average paying job than others
A further explanation of the big jump of jobs in 2023 compared to all other year that were looked at
If the data set was biased based on a particular country, type of job, or other details of the employees surveyed
If this data set is a good/accurate representation of the population at large

Questions:
-What are the most popoular data science jobs by title?
   Create a chart showing count of job title by year to determine what jobs are growing over the time period (2020-2024). Create pie charts for 2024 showing job title frequency. Take the top five job titles and calculate trend lines to show the growth of those jobs during last four years.
-How does experience influence salary?
    Create graphs showing the salary and experience ranges
    Create scatter plot of experience vs. salary (including all job titles)

    Data visualization showing countries included in the dataset. Create points on map to show different stats:
        Top salary per country
        Entry level salary per country
        Most popular data science roles per country
